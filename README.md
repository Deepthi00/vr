#About the App
###The Virtual Optics Application is an eye checkup app in which makes a primary eye check-up that can be done by any Individual at any instance using Virtual Reality without the help of an Optometrist. All it need is a VR Headset and the Android app. The App provides a Virtual Environment where the user can see boards with letters / symbols / colors around him placed at different distances. Then the user should select the colors based on his sight whether the board is visible or not. To the extent where the letters are not clearly visible to the user is measured internally and based on that readings Virtual lenses are slotted into the VR until the letters are clearly visible to the user. After eye check the user will be asked some questions based on colors what they saw to ensure that they donâ€™t have Color Blindness problem. The final report contains the type of sight issue, the lens power to the subject and some suggestion that might help the user to control their sight issue.
